## PH-STAT (Statistical Inference on Persistent Homology)

MATLAB Toolbox for Statistical Inference on Persistent Homology

Currently under developemnt since 2023 but we made some of codes avaible for test run and debug purpose. Please provide feedback and correction. 

Simply load MATLAB live editor file [SCRIPT.mlx](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/PH-STAT/blob/main/SCRIPT.mlx). The detailed manual is available as arXiv at [arXiv:2304.05912](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05912). The package can perform the following topological tasks (topological clustering, topological embedding, topoloical time frequency analysis).
