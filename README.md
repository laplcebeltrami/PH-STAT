## PH-STAT (Statistical Inference on Persistent Homology)

MATLAB Toolbox for Statistical Inference on Persistent Homology

Currently under developemnt but we made some of codes avaible for test run and debug purpose. Please provide feedback and corrections. Simply load MATLAB live editor file [SCRIPT.mlx](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/PH-STAT/blob/main/SCRIPT.mlx). The detailed manual is available [here (last updated on Feb, 2025)](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/PH-STAT/blob/main/PH-STAT.pdf) or as arXiv at [arXiv:2304.05912](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05912). 

The package can perform the following topological tasks: Rips filtration, graph fltration, topological clustering, topological embedding, topoloical spectogram. The codes are constnatly updated and debugged.
