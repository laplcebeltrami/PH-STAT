## PH-STAT (Statistical Inference on Persistent Homology)

MATLAB Toolbox for Statistical Inference on Persistent Homology

Currently under developemnt but we made some of codes avaible for test run and debug purpose. Please provide feedback and correction. 

Simply load MATLAB live editor file [SCRIPT.mlx](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/PH-STAT/blob/main/SCRIPT.mlx). The detailed manual is available at [arXiv:2304.05912](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05912) 


Now the package can do topological embedding 
[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07835](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07835).

The package was used to perform the following topological tasks (topological clustering, topological embedding, topoloical time frequency analysis) given in the lecture
[ICSA 2024, June 17](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/PH-STAT/blob/main/2024.06.17.ICSA.pdf) and [ISBI 2024, October 10 keynote](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/PH-STAT/blob/main/2024.10.10.MICCAI.pdf).
